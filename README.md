Microbiome and Machine Learning for Inflammatory Bowel Disease diagnosis


244 fecal samples were collected at different time points from 65 IBD patients, 34 from CD and 31 from UC, and 112 fecal samples from 112 healthy individuals, differentiated in 54 healthy controls non-related to the IBD patients (HC), 29 healthy relatives of Crohnâ€™s patients (HC-CD) and 29 healthy relatives of ulcerative colitis patients (HC-UC).

Samples were collected from IBD patients in remission at baseline in a longitudinal setting every three month over a period of one year. When IBD patients underwent a relapse, they provided the last sample around the relapse time. The samples analysed in this project were part of previous projects namely the IBS project [Pozuelo et al., 2015] regarding the non-related healthy controls and the MetaHIT project for the IBD samples.

The present work reported the following main objectives:

First, we focused on describing the demographic and clinical characteristics of the recruited individuals (patients and healthy) and on explaining the different groups of participants, as well as the microbiome data generated from the biological samples collected for the study. In addition, we provided a brief explanation on the bioinformatics pipeline used to perform the sequence analysis.

Then, we undertook the analysis of the data on hand to characterize the microbiome composition of IBD in general, CD and UC separately, and disease activity. We also introduced the statistical methods used to compare microbiome variables and to correlate clinical data with microbiome data. We finally described how statistical models were built to attempt to diagnose and to predict disease activity.
